# HandshakeInternshipOrganizer
##A simple program built with Python that allows the user to their Byui-Handshake Internships by application deadline.
This program allows the user to login to their Handshake account via a GUI made in Tkinter. The account information is then processed and directed to the Handshake website via Selenium. Once at the Handshake website, the program will direct itself to the saved_jobs page and begin recording every saved internship. Once this is done, the internships are sorted by application deadline and are outputted in a text file.
